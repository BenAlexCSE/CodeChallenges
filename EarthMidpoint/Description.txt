Assignment: Write a module/package in Python or Javascript that implements a function with the following characteristics:
1.       Input: two locations (“from” and “to”) each defined by a pair of latitude/longitude coordinates
2.       Output: The midpoint on the shortest path between these two locations on the surface of the Earth
Bonus points: Returning a path of N coordinates evenly spaced along the path



To Run the application, open EarthMidpoint.exe



The application will query the user for latitude and longitude for the first point

Then the application will query the user for latitude and longitude for the second point

The application will compute and display the midpoint

The application will continue and ask the User to enter a number of points to find between our start point and our destination point

The application will print N different points evenly spaced between our start point and our destination point.
